A very simple Vite plugin for stripping comments in your production code. Some comments just don't get removed no matter what minify options you set, especially `/* istanbul ignore */` flags. Keep in mind this is experimental, please **use with caution**.

## Install

```bash
pnpm install -D vite-plugin-strip-comments
```

```bash
yarn add -D vite-plugin-strip-comments
```

```bash
npm install -D vite-plugin-strip-comments
```

```bash
deno add -D npm:vite-plugin-strip-comments@latest
```

## Usage

```ts
// vite.config.mts
import stripComments from 'vite-plugin-strip-comments';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    stripComments({ type: 'none' }),
    // 'none' means to keep no comments
  ],
});
```

**Options**

* type: "none" | "keep-legal" (default) - changes the behavior of the transform function
  * **none** removes all comments
  * **keep-legal** remove all commments except those which contain `@legal` or `@license`, a very good practice to allow open source to shine yes?
* enforce: "pre" (default) | "post" - determines where in the compilation pipeline the plugin should work;
